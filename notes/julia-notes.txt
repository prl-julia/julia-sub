Stupid question: could you encode the Julia type system in Datalog? All Datalog programs terminate, so that would be one way to guarantee decidability. 
There was a recent OOPSLA/ECOOP paper where they implemented a type system in Datalog, so they could use it for incremental type checking in an IDE.

Use simpler subtyping' for resolving bounds. Not use general subtyping for it.
